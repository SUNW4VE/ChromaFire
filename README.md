Why use this over legacy chromafire?
- 94% --> 98% in-game accuracy
- Lower-level implementation
- No setup required
- Non-white checks instead of red checks (more predictable)
- Massive overhead reduction (and therefore signal-to-latency reduction)
- No reported bugs
- Not world infamous spaghetti code
